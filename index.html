        <h1>Pirate Action</h1>
        <h4>Pirate radio has existed since the early days of radio, but advances in technology have allowed for the creation of a new breed of small, highly-mobile pirate radio stations.  Unlicensed broadcasters can pose a hazard to the community by interfering with public safety frequencies.  In addition, pirate stations compete unfairly with licensed broadcasters for advertising dollars.  Such pirate operators pose a significant challenge to track and shut down, but the Enforcement Bureau’s Field offices work around the clock, using the latest technology, to accomplish this mission. This map tracks the Enforcement Bureau’s efforts to shut down such stations and take aggressive enforcement action against the operators and those who assist them.  It consists of Bureau or Commission orders related to pirate radio operations, but does not include unpublished informal warnings, which may be issued in appropriate circumstances.</h4>
